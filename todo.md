# Multi-threaded search algorithm #

* Notes
    * We should be able to modify the search algorithm such that it can
        * Copy change lists from source sandbox to destination sandbox.
        * Find files in database given patterns using vertical search engines (Lucene++)?
    * Have a function which return the differences between two vectors. This should be a template function so we can test it separately.

* Todo
    * Change commands to mlocate, mdiff, mupdatedb, mcopy with better help.
    * Support JSON output format.
